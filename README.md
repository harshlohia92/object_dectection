### 🧠 Object Detection Mini-System using YOLOv8 + OpenCV
This project is a real-time object detection mini-system built using the YOLOv8 model, OpenCV, and a simple SQLite database.

It detects common objects (like bottles, laptops, phones, etc.) using your webcam and logs every detection in a database.
